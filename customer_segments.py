# ## Getting Started
#
# In this project, you will analyze a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in *monetary units*) of diverse product categories for internal structure. One goal of this project is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. Doing so would equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer.
#
# The dataset for this project can be found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers). For the purposes of this project, the features `'Channel'` and `'Region'` will be excluded in the analysis â€” with focus instead on the six product categories recorded for customers.
#
# Run the code block below to load the wholesale customers dataset, along with a few of the necessary Python libraries required for this project. You will know the dataset loaded successfully if the size of the dataset is reported.

# In[1]:


# Import libraries necessary for this project
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import display # Allows the use of display() for DataFrames

# Import supplementary visualizations code visuals.py
import visuals as vs

# Pretty display for notebooks
get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')

# Load the wholesale customers dataset
try:
    data = pd.read_csv("customers.csv")
    data.drop(['Region', 'Channel'], axis = 1, inplace = True)
    print("Wholesale customers dataset has {} samples with {} features each.".format(*data.shape))
except:
    print("Dataset could not be loaded. Is the dataset missing?")


# ## Data Exploration
# In this section, you will begin exploring the data through visualizations and code to understand how each feature is related to the others. You will observe a statistical description of the dataset, consider the relevance of each feature, and select a few sample data points from the dataset which you will track through the course of this project.
#
# Run the code block below to observe a statistical description of the dataset. Note that the dataset is composed of six important product categories: **'Fresh'**, **'Milk'**, **'Grocery'**, **'Frozen'**, **'Detergents_Paper'**, and **'Delicatessen'**. Consider what each category represents in terms of products you could purchase.

# In[2]:


# Display a description of the dataset
display(data.describe())


# ### Implementation: Selecting Samples
# To get a better understanding of the customers and how their data will transform through the analysis, it would be best to select a few sample data points and explore them in more detail. In the code block below, add **three** indices of your choice to the `indices` list which will represent the customers to track. It is suggested to try different sets of samples until you obtain customers that vary significantly from one another.

# In[3]:


# TODO: Select three indices of your choice you wish to sample from the dataset
indices = [77,167,322]

# Create a DataFrame of the chosen samples
samples = pd.DataFrame(data.loc[indices], columns = data.keys()).reset_index(drop = True)
print("Chosen samples of wholesale customers dataset:")
display(samples)


# ### Question 1
# Consider the total purchase cost of each product category and the statistical description of the dataset above for your sample customers.
#
# * What kind of establishment (customer) could each of the three samples you've chosen represent?
#
# **Hint:** Examples of establishments include places like markets, cafes, delis, wholesale retailers, among many others. Avoid using names for establishments, such as saying *"McDonalds"* when describing a sample customer as a restaurant. You can use the mean values for reference to compare your samples with. The mean values are as follows:
#
# * Fresh: 12000.2977
# * Milk: 5796.2
# * Grocery: 3071.9
# * Detergents_paper: 2881.4
# * Delicatessen: 1524.8
#
# Knowing this, how do your samples compare? Does that help in driving your insight into what kind of establishments they might be?
#

# **Answer: **
# 1. I will admit it is a bit difficult to understand what establishments each of the three samples are. It would be nice if the features were abit more descriptive of what they represent. My best guess will be that example one is a grocery store as it has a large value for grocery. Example two seems to be a smaller store so potential a convenience store. The third example seems to focues more on fresh foods so it could be a resturant.
# 2. The means values do help in providing insight. Seeing what the average between each feature helps to determine what is the normal amount of spending. So if a feature value reports a lower than average value it could mean that the feature is not one of the major focus for that establishment. Such as my example one, having a value higher than average in grocery could mean its a grocery store as they would spend more.

# ### Implementation: Feature Relevance
# One interesting thought to consider is if one (or more) of the six product categories is actually relevant for understanding customer purchasing. That is to say, is it possible to determine whether customers purchasing some amount of one category of products will necessarily purchase some proportional amount of another category of products? We can make this determination quite easily by training a supervised regression learner on a subset of the data with one feature removed, and then score how well that model can predict the removed feature.
#
# In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
#  - Assign `new_data` a copy of the data by removing a feature of your choice using the `DataFrame.drop` function.
#  - Use `sklearn.cross_validation.train_test_split` to split the dataset into training and testing sets.
#    - Use the removed feature as your target label. Set a `test_size` of `0.25` and set a `random_state`.
#  - Import a decision tree regressor, set a `random_state`, and fit the learner to the training data.
#  - Report the prediction score of the testing set using the regressor's `score` function.

# In[4]:


from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import make_scorer

# TODO: Make a copy of the DataFrame, using the 'drop' function to drop the given feature
new_data = data.drop(['Frozen'], axis=1)

# TODO: Split the data into training and testing sets(0.25) using the given feature as the target
# Set a random state.
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(new_data,data['Frozen'], test_size = .25, random_state = 1)

# TODO: Create a decision tree regressor and fit it to the training set
regressor = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state=0)
after_train = regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)

# TODO: Report the score of the prediction using the testing set
score = regressor.score(X_test, y_test)

score


# ### Question 2
#
# * Which feature did you attempt to predict?
# * What was the reported prediction score?
# * Is this feature necessary for identifying customers' spending habits?
#
# **Hint:** The coefficient of determination, `R^2`, is scored between 0 and 1, with 1 being a perfect fit. A negative `R^2` implies the model fails to fit the data. If you get a low score for a particular feature, that lends us to beleive that that feature point is hard to predict using the other features, thereby making it an important feature to consider when considering relevance.

# **Answer:**
# 1. Frozen
# 2. The reported score was -0.6965500183018567
# 3. Frozen can be a neccessary feature to determine customer spending habaits. It recieved a score of -0.697, a low score. A low score means that Frozen is not that correlated to the other features. Since it is difficult to correlate to the other features it can then be used to consider relevance. A higher score would mean that the feature is highly correlated to the other features which can make it easier to predict.

# ### Visualize Feature Distributions
# To get a better understanding of the dataset, we can construct a scatter matrix of each of the six product features present in the data. If you found that the feature you attempted to predict above is relevant for identifying a specific customer, then the scatter matrix below may not show any correlation between that feature and the others. Conversely, if you believe that feature is not relevant for identifying a specific customer, the scatter matrix might show a correlation between that feature and another feature in the data. Run the code block below to produce a scatter matrix.

# In[5]:


# Produce a scatter matrix for each pair of features in the data
pd.scatter_matrix(data, alpha = 0.3, figsize = (15,9), diagonal = 'kde');


# ### Question 3
# * Using the scatter matrix as a reference, discuss the distribution of the dataset, specifically talk about the normality, outliers, large number of data points near 0 among others. If you need to sepearate out some of the plots individually to further accentuate your point, you may do so as well.
# * Are there any pairs of features which exhibit some degree of correlation?
# * Does this confirm or deny your suspicions about the relevance of the feature you attempted to predict?
# * How is the data for those features distributed?
#
# **Hint:** Is the data normally distributed? Where do most of the data points lie? You can use [corr()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.corr.html) to get the feature correlations and then visualize them using a [heatmap](http://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.heatmap.html) (the data that would be fed into the heatmap would be the correlation values, for eg: `data.corr()`) to gain further insight.

# **Answer:**
# 1. The data does not seem to be normally distributed. The majority of the points are centered around the origin. There seems to be some similarity between grocery and detergents as they have very similar graphs. Milk also seems to have some correlations grocery and detergents. Further analyzing the scatter plots I can confirm that frozen is not very relevant to the other features.

# ## Data Preprocessing
# In this section, you will preprocess the data to create a better representation of customers by performing a scaling on the data and detecting (and optionally removing) outliers. Preprocessing data is often times a critical step in assuring that results you obtain from your analysis are significant and meaningful.

# ### Implementation: Feature Scaling
# If data is not normally distributed, especially if the mean and median vary significantly (indicating a large skew), it is most [often appropriate](http://econbrowser.com/archives/2014/02/use-of-logarithms-in-economics) to apply a non-linear scaling â€” particularly for financial data. One way to achieve this scaling is by using a [Box-Cox test](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/generated/scipy.stats.boxcox.html), which calculates the best power transformation of the data that reduces skewness. A simpler approach which can work in most cases would be applying the natural logarithm.
#
# In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
#  - Assign a copy of the data to `log_data` after applying logarithmic scaling. Use the `np.log` function for this.
#  - Assign a copy of the sample data to `log_samples` after applying logarithmic scaling. Again, use `np.log`.

# In[6]:


# TODO: Scale the data using the natural logarithm
log_data = np.log(data)

# TODO: Scale the sample data using the natural logarithm
log_samples = np.log(samples)

# Produce a scatter matrix for each pair of newly-transformed features
pd.scatter_matrix(log_data, alpha = 0.3, figsize = (15,9), diagonal = 'kde');


# ### Observation
# After applying a natural logarithm scaling to the data, the distribution of each feature should appear much more normal. For any pairs of features you may have identified earlier as being correlated, observe here whether that correlation is still present (and whether it is now stronger or weaker than before).
#
# Run the code below to see how the sample data has changed after having the natural logarithm applied to it.

# In[7]:


# Display the log-transformed sample data
display(log_samples)


# ### Implementation: Outlier Detection
# Detecting outliers in the data is extremely important in the data preprocessing step of any analysis. The presence of outliers can often skew results which take into consideration these data points. There are many "rules of thumb" for what constitutes an outlier in a dataset. Here, we will use [Tukey's Method for identfying outliers](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/01/3-methods-deal-outliers.html): An *outlier step* is calculated as 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR). A data point with a feature that is beyond an outlier step outside of the IQR for that feature is considered abnormal.
#
# In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
#  - Assign the value of the 25th percentile for the given feature to `Q1`. Use `np.percentile` for this.
#  - Assign the value of the 75th percentile for the given feature to `Q3`. Again, use `np.percentile`.
#  - Assign the calculation of an outlier step for the given feature to `step`.
#  - Optionally remove data points from the dataset by adding indices to the `outliers` list.
#
# **NOTE:** If you choose to remove any outliers, ensure that the sample data does not contain any of these points!
# Once you have performed this implementation, the dataset will be stored in the variable `good_data`.

# In[8]:


# For each feature find the data points with extreme high or low values
for feature in log_data.keys():

    # TODO: Calculate Q1 (25th percentile of the data) for the given feature
    Q1 = np.percentile(log_data[feature], 25)

    # TODO: Calculate Q3 (75th percentile of the data) for the given feature
    Q3 = np.percentile(log_data[feature], 75)

    # TODO: Use the interquartile range to calculate an outlier step (1.5 times the interquartile range)
    step = 1.5*(Q3-Q1)

    # Display the outliers
    print("Data points considered outliers for the feature '{}':".format(feature))
    display(log_data[~((log_data[feature] >= Q1 - step) & (log_data[feature] <= Q3 + step))])

# OPTIONAL: Select the indices for data points you wish to remove
outliers  = [65, 66, 75, 128, 154]

# Remove the outliers, if any were specified
good_data = log_data.drop(log_data.index[outliers]).reset_index(drop = True)


# ### Question 4
# * Are there any data points considered outliers for more than one feature based on the definition above?
# * Should these data points be removed from the dataset?
# * If any data points were added to the `outliers` list to be removed, explain why.
#
# ** Hint: ** If you have datapoints that are outliers in multiple categories think about why that may be and if they warrant removal. Also note how k-means is affected by outliers and whether or not this plays a factor in your analysis of whether or not to remove them.

# **Answer:**
# 1. Yes, after looking through the points 65, 66, 75, 128, 154.
# 2. At first I did not remove any of the outliers. Then when I went back to see the difference I noticed that there was a better silhouette score. It was not a huge difference but still it was better. So I would remove the outliers.
# 3. I removed the following outliers because as mentioned in the hint, "K-means is affected by outliers". K-means is affected by outliers because k-means tries to optimize the sum of squares. So when there is an outlier, that outlier is given a lot of weight.

# ## Feature Transformation
# In this section you will use principal component analysis (PCA) to draw conclusions about the underlying structure of the wholesale customer data. Since using PCA on a dataset calculates the dimensions which best maximize variance, we will find which compound combinations of features best describe customers.

# ### Implementation: PCA
#
# Now that the data has been scaled to a more normal distribution and has had any necessary outliers removed, we can now apply PCA to the `good_data` to discover which dimensions about the data best maximize the variance of features involved. In addition to finding these dimensions, PCA will also report the *explained variance ratio* of each dimension â€” how much variance within the data is explained by that dimension alone. Note that a component (dimension) from PCA can be considered a new "feature" of the space, however it is a composition of the original features present in the data.
#
# In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
#  - Import `sklearn.decomposition.PCA` and assign the results of fitting PCA in six dimensions with `good_data` to `pca`.
#  - Apply a PCA transformation of `log_samples` using `pca.transform`, and assign the results to `pca_samples`.

# In[9]:


from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

# TODO: Apply PCA by fitting the good data with the same number of dimensions as features
pca = PCA(n_components=6).fit(good_data)

# TODO: Transform log_samples using the PCA fit above
pca_samples = pca.transform(log_samples)

# Generate PCA results plot
pca_results = vs.pca_results(good_data, pca)


# ### Question 5
#
# * How much variance in the data is explained* **in total** *by the first and second principal component?
# * How much variance in the data is explained by the first four principal components?
# * Using the visualization provided above, talk about each dimension and the cumulative variance explained by each, stressing upon which features are well represented by each dimension(both in terms of positive and negative variance explained). Discuss what the first four dimensions best represent in terms of customer spending.
#
# **Hint:** A positive increase in a specific dimension corresponds with an *increase* of the *positive-weighted* features and a *decrease* of the *negative-weighted* features. The rate of increase or decrease is based on the individual feature weights.

# **Answer:**
# 1. The total variance explained by the first and second components is .7229.
# 2. The total variance explained by the first four principal components is .9318
# 3.
#
# Dimension 1:
# Detergents, Grocery, and Milk dominates the first dimension. Detergent has a high negative weight while Grocery and milk are near similar in weight as well. These value are somewhat near in value to each other which means there is some corellation between the three. If one decreases then the others will more than likely follow. This could be representative of a large retail company like Walmart.
#
# Dimension 2:
# Fresh, frozen, and delicatessen dominate the second dimension. Fresh has a high negative weight, with frozen and delicatessen following after with weights around -.5. These values are correlated as well as they share negative weights as well. If one were to change the others would follow suit. This could represent a resturant as they would need fresh foods, frozen products, and cold cuts or salads.
#
# Dimension 3:
# Fresh, delicatessen, detergents dominate the third dimension. Fresh has a high negative weight and Delicatessen has a high positive weight. These two features are signifacntely important due to their high negative and positive values. This one is a bit more difficult to interpret what it could represent. I would say this dimension is best represented by a local grocery store. Local grocery stores usually have fresh and frozen foods, but also some detergents and paper.
#
# Dimension 4:
# Frozen, Fresh, delicatessen dominate the fourth dimension. Frozen leads this component with a high positive weight hovering .8. The next two in this compnent are follwed by fresh and delicatessen with a weight of around -.3. I would say a convenience store or corner store like Walgreens.

# ### Observation
# Run the code below to see how the log-transformed sample data has changed after having a PCA transformation applied to it in six dimensions. Observe the numerical value for the first four dimensions of the sample points. Consider if this is consistent with your initial interpretation of the sample points.

# In[10]:


# Display sample log-data after having a PCA transformation applied
display(pd.DataFrame(np.round(pca_samples, 4), columns = pca_results.index.values))


# ### Implementation: Dimensionality Reduction
# When using principal component analysis, one of the main goals is to reduce the dimensionality of the data â€” in effect, reducing the complexity of the problem. Dimensionality reduction comes at a cost: Fewer dimensions used implies less of the total variance in the data is being explained. Because of this, the *cumulative explained variance ratio* is extremely important for knowing how many dimensions are necessary for the problem. Additionally, if a signifiant amount of variance is explained by only two or three dimensions, the reduced data can be visualized afterwards.
#
# In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
#  - Assign the results of fitting PCA in two dimensions with `good_data` to `pca`.
#  - Apply a PCA transformation of `good_data` using `pca.transform`, and assign the results to `reduced_data`.
#  - Apply a PCA transformation of `log_samples` using `pca.transform`, and assign the results to `pca_samples`.

# In[11]:


# TODO: Apply PCA by fitting the good data with only two dimensions
pca = PCA(n_components=2).fit(good_data)

# TODO: Transform the good data using the PCA fit above
reduced_data = pca.transform(good_data)

# TODO: Transform log_samples using the PCA fit above
pca_samples = pca.transform(log_samples)

# Create a DataFrame for the reduced data
reduced_data = pd.DataFrame(reduced_data, columns = ['Dimension 1', 'Dimension 2'])


# ### Observation
# Run the code below to see how the log-transformed sample data has changed after having a PCA transformation applied to it using only two dimensions. Observe how the values for the first two dimensions remains unchanged when compared to a PCA transformation in six dimensions.

# In[12]:


# Display sample log-data after applying PCA transformation in two dimensions
display(pd.DataFrame(np.round(pca_samples, 4), columns = ['Dimension 1', 'Dimension 2']))


# ## Visualizing a Biplot
# A biplot is a scatterplot where each data point is represented by its scores along the principal components. The axes are the principal components (in this case `Dimension 1` and `Dimension 2`). In addition, the biplot shows the projection of the original features along the components. A biplot can help us interpret the reduced dimensions of the data, and discover relationships between the principal components and original features.
#
# Run the code cell below to produce a biplot of the reduced-dimension data.

# In[13]:


# Create a biplot
vs.biplot(good_data, reduced_data, pca)


# ### Observation
#
# Once we have the original feature projections (in red), it is easier to interpret the relative position of each data point in the scatterplot. For instance, a point the lower right corner of the figure will likely correspond to a customer that spends a lot on `'Milk'`, `'Grocery'` and `'Detergents_Paper'`, but not so much on the other product categories.
#
# From the biplot, which of the original features are most strongly correlated with the first component? What about those that are associated with the second component? Do these observations agree with the pca_results plot you obtained earlier?

# ## Clustering
#
# In this section, you will choose to use either a K-Means clustering algorithm or a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm to identify the various customer segments hidden in the data. You will then recover specific data points from the clusters to understand their significance by transforming them back into their original dimension and scale.

# ### Question 6
#
# * What are the advantages to using a K-Means clustering algorithm?
# * What are the advantages to using a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm?
# * Given your observations about the wholesale customer data so far, which of the two algorithms will you use and why?
#
# ** Hint: ** Think about the differences between hard clustering and soft clustering and which would be appropriate for our dataset.

# **Answer:**
# 1. K-Means advantages are that it is easy to implement, it is computationally faster with a large number of variables.
# 2. Gaussian Mixture model clustering advantages are that its cluster shape is flexible. GMM clustering also is a soft clustering, a sample membership of multiple clusters.
# 3. I will use K-means as it is easier to implement and faster computationally. I also did a bit of research online and it seems there is some relationship in between Kmeans and PCA (http://ranger.uta.edu/~chqding/papers/KmeansPCA1.pdf). PCA can be an indicator for how many clusters Kmeans may need. So from our PCA analysis it could be potentially inferred that 2 cluster will be needed. 2 clusters because from PCA we can see that the first two components have the largest value.
#
# **Side note: I will still try GMM out of curiosity......

# ### Implementation: Creating Clusters
# Depending on the problem, the number of clusters that you expect to be in the data may already be known. When the number of clusters is not known *a priori*, there is no guarantee that a given number of clusters best segments the data, since it is unclear what structure exists in the data â€” if any. However, we can quantify the "goodness" of a clustering by calculating each data point's *silhouette coefficient*. The [silhouette coefficient](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score.html) for a data point measures how similar it is to its assigned cluster from -1 (dissimilar) to 1 (similar). Calculating the *mean* silhouette coefficient provides for a simple scoring method of a given clustering.
#
# In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
#  - Fit a clustering algorithm to the `reduced_data` and assign it to `clusterer`.
#  - Predict the cluster for each data point in `reduced_data` using `clusterer.predict` and assign them to `preds`.
#  - Find the cluster centers using the algorithm's respective attribute and assign them to `centers`.
#  - Predict the cluster for each sample data point in `pca_samples` and assign them `sample_preds`.
#  - Import `sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score` and calculate the silhouette score of `reduced_data` against `preds`.
#    - Assign the silhouette score to `score` and print the result.

# In[29]:


from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score

# TODO: Apply your clustering algorithm of choice to the reduced data
clusterer = KMeans(n_clusters=2).fit(reduced_data)

# TODO: Predict the cluster for each data point
preds = clusterer.predict(reduced_data)

# TODO: Find the cluster centers
centers = clusterer.cluster_centers_

# TODO: Predict the cluster for each transformed sample data point
sample_preds = clusterer.predict(pca_samples)

# TODO: Calculate the mean silhouette coefficient for the number of clusters chosen
score = silhouette_score(reduced_data, preds)

score
#also writing this to test my git hub capacity with atom


# ### Question 7
#
# * Report the silhouette score for several cluster numbers you tried.
# * Of these, which number of clusters has the best silhouette score?

# **Answer:**
# 1.
# N=2 -> .4262
# N=3 -> .3933
# N=4 -> .3327
# N=5 -> .3509
# N=6 -> .3537
# N=7 -> .3631
# N=8 -> .3561
# 2. The optimal amount of clusters is 2.

# ### Cluster Visualization
# Once you've chosen the optimal number of clusters for your clustering algorithm using the scoring metric above, you can now visualize the results by executing the code block below. Note that, for experimentation purposes, you are welcome to adjust the number of clusters for your clustering algorithm to see various visualizations. The final visualization provided should, however, correspond with the optimal number of clusters.

# In[16]:


# Display the results of the clustering from implementation
vs.cluster_results(reduced_data, preds, centers, pca_samples)


# ### Implementation: Data Recovery
# Each cluster present in the visualization above has a central point. These centers (or means) are not specifically data points from the data, but rather the *averages* of all the data points predicted in the respective clusters. For the problem of creating customer segments, a cluster's center point corresponds to *the average customer of that segment*. Since the data is currently reduced in dimension and scaled by a logarithm, we can recover the representative customer spending from these data points by applying the inverse transformations.
#
# In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
#  - Apply the inverse transform to `centers` using `pca.inverse_transform` and assign the new centers to `log_centers`.
#  - Apply the inverse function of `np.log` to `log_centers` using `np.exp` and assign the true centers to `true_centers`.
#

# In[17]:


# TODO: Inverse transform the centers
log_centers = pca.inverse_transform(centers)

# TODO: Exponentiate the centers
true_centers = np.exp(log_centers)

# Display the true centers
segments = ['Segment {}'.format(i) for i in range(0,len(centers))]
true_centers = pd.DataFrame(np.round(true_centers), columns = data.keys())
true_centers.index = segments
display(true_centers)

display(data.describe())


# ### Question 8
#
# * Consider the total purchase cost of each product category for the representative data points above, and reference the statistical description of the dataset at the beginning of this project(specifically looking at the mean values for the various feature points). What set of establishments could each of the customer segments represent?
#
# **Hint:** A customer who is assigned to `'Cluster X'` should best identify with the establishments represented by the feature set of `'Segment X'`. Think about what each segment represents in terms their values for the feature points chosen. Reference these values with the mean values to get some perspective into what kind of establishment they represent.

# **Answer:**
# 1. Segment 0 can represent the restaraunts, cafes, small food shops. The values represented by the means can be seen to be alot smaller than what is average. The values are better matched with the 25% and 50% quartiles.
#
# 2. Segment 1 can represent the large grocery store and retailers. The values are generally above average and better represented by the 50% and 75% quartiles.

# ### Question 9
#
# * For each sample point, which customer segment from* **Question 8** *best represents it?
# * Are the predictions for each sample point consistent with this?*
#
# Run the code block below to find which cluster each sample point is predicted to be.

# In[32]:


# Display the predictions
for i, pred in enumerate(sample_preds):
    print("Sample point", i, "predicted to be in Cluster", pred)



# **Answer:**
# Sample 0:
# Sample 0 was best represented by cluster 1 which is consistent as there was high grocery and detergents_paper value.
#
# Sample 1:
# Sample 1 was best represented by cluster 1. Now this one may not seem so when comparing its values to the means, but using feature scaling helped put its value in perspective. I guessed a convenience store mainly because I looked at what value was its highest and compared it to the others. Sample 1's value highest is grocery just like Sample 0, the only difference is the value so I saw a similarity in the two as grocery was its highest cost. Thus showing the importance further of feature scaling.
#
# Sample 2:
# Sample 2 was best represented by cluster 0, which is conisitent with a high fresh food value.

# ## Conclusion

# In this final section, you will investigate ways that you can make use of the clustered data. First, you will consider how the different groups of customers, the ***customer segments***, may be affected differently by a specific delivery scheme. Next, you will consider how giving a label to each customer (which *segment* that customer belongs to) can provide for additional features about the customer data. Finally, you will compare the ***customer segments*** to a hidden variable present in the data, to see whether the clustering identified certain relationships.

# ### Question 10
# Companies will often run [A/B tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing) when making small changes to their products or services to determine whether making that change will affect its customers positively or negatively. The wholesale distributor is considering changing its delivery service from currently 5 days a week to 3 days a week. However, the distributor will only make this change in delivery service for customers that react positively.
#
# * How can the wholesale distributor use the customer segments to determine which customers, if any, would react positively to the change in delivery service?*
#
# **Hint:** Can we assume the change affects all customers equally? How can we determine which group of customers it affects the most?

# **Answer:**
# 1. Using the customer segments it can be inferred that each customer will have different needs for delivery. Walmart will need fresh food deliveries to maintain freshness, but would not need deliveries on frozen foods. Resturants would need fresh deliveries as well. The customer segements do vary so we can not treat them equally. I would say the best way to test a change in delivery is to use the A/B test on random points from each customer segment. Increase delivery for a small portion of each cluster and then analyze the response from that test group.

# ### Question 11
# Additional structure is derived from originally unlabeled data when using clustering techniques. Since each customer has a ***customer segment*** it best identifies with (depending on the clustering algorithm applied), we can consider *'customer segment'* as an **engineered feature** for the data. Assume the wholesale distributor recently acquired ten new customers and each provided estimates for anticipated annual spending of each product category. Knowing these estimates, the wholesale distributor wants to classify each new customer to a ***customer segment*** to determine the most appropriate delivery service.
# * How can the wholesale distributor label the new customers using only their estimated product spending and the **customer segment** data?
#
# **Hint:** A supervised learner could be used to train on the original customers. What would be the target variable?

# **Answer:**
#
# 1. Using a surpervised algorithm such as a support vector machine, naive bayes, or k-nearest neighbor can be used to classify the new data point based on their porduct spending. The new customers can then be seperated into either the first or the second cluster depending on their value.

# ### Visualizing Underlying Distributions
#
# At the beginning of this project, it was discussed that the `'Channel'` and `'Region'` features would be excluded from the dataset so that the customer product categories were emphasized in the analysis. By reintroducing the `'Channel'` feature to the dataset, an interesting structure emerges when considering the same PCA dimensionality reduction applied earlier to the original dataset.
#
# Run the code block below to see how each data point is labeled either `'HoReCa'` (Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe) or `'Retail'` the reduced space. In addition, you will find the sample points are circled in the plot, which will identify their labeling.

# ### Question 12
#
# * How well does the clustering algorithm and number of clusters you've chosen compare to this underlying distribution of Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe customers to Retailer customers?
# * Are there customer segments that would be classified as purely 'Retailers' or 'Hotels/Restaurants/Cafes' by this distribution?
# * Would you consider these classifications as consistent with your previous definition of the customer segments?

# **Answer:**
# 1. The comparison of the distriubuiton above to my choice of K-means with two clusters can be described as almost identical. The graph above visual depicts 2 clusters, which is what I decided to use in my clustering algorithm.
#
# 2. There is cleary points of the data that can be labled one or the other. There are also points that are mixed into the other cluster. These points could be the inbetweens shops that are not either purely retailer or hotel/restaurants/cafe.
#
# 3. I would consider the classifications to be consistent because they are very similar. Each used two clusters, and each have a clear definition of the customer segements.
